📢 `Hello World!!!` If you are reading this, consider you lucky, you just found something that will change, or at least I hope, your future as a developer. Something that will guide you through your long, but how wonderful, programming journey. But let's not unnecessarily lengthen the intro, to the point!

Ps: I know that you are a busy dev, so our organization will also focus on that.

## What's ᗯOᖇᒪᗪ Iᑎ ᗪEᐯ?

From our tagline: In a sentence: we are cool, and you *need* to follow us.
From our Bio: @WorldInDev is a programming community for *exchanging* ideas and *foster* innovation. We *provide* daily code news, weekly digest, and monthly events.
To elaborate: We are a "made by devs for devs" community, founded with the utopian objective of making code accessible for everyone. We firmly believe in free access to coding and education, at any age.  We want to help all devs, from the ones who are about to start (and I add for these, good luck!) to the most experienced ones. Our core values ​​are equality, respect, and fun!

But, as I show you now, we don't just sell smoke:

## Why we will help you:

Or: What do we do? Although we have already drawn the lines of our future path, they have not yet been drawn. We plan to start as a dev.to based blogging organization, with different series running contemporaneously. Discord will allow us to be more user-focused. We don't want to be static. The main objective of going beyond a simple blog is to empower communication between developers and pair programming. Look at other famous websites in programming: Stack Overflow, GitHub, or even Dev.to. They are all based on devs helping other devs. And this is what we want to do. To do this we are building a cooperation program between developers. The ones more experimented will partner with a newcomer in programming. Then each binomial can participate in coding events that we will host, with special prizes for 🏆winners🏆. This leads to another of our big objectives. We will be 𝕒𝕔𝕥𝕚𝕧𝕖, mostly with daily articles and monthly events, and trying to improve every day.

## Our plans for the future

First, we will try to create an active community on discord, dev.to, and twitter. Our major goal is to be able to help as many developers as possible, providing a community. Our second goal is to host how many events as possible, giveaways, hackathons, code battles... Then with a solid community, in the more distant future, we will create a website and extension to help developers in their daily life. A kind of dev companion with lots of features, but let's say no more for now...

## We also need your help
