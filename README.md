# 📢 `Hello World!!!`

![line break](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ash96231zzgp1b26ijw.gif)

If you are reading this, consider yourself lucky, you just found something that will change, or at least I hope, your future as a developer—something that will guide you through your long yet incredible programming journey.

But let's not unnecessarily lengthen the intro—To the point!

Ps: I know that you are a busy dev, so our organization will also focus on that.

## What's [ᗯOᖇᒪᗪ Iᑎ ᗪEᐯ](https://dev.to/worldindev)?

Our Tagline:

> In a sentence: we are cool, and you *need* to follow us.

Our Bio:

> @WorldInDev is a programming community for *exchanging* ideas and *foster* innovation. We *provide* daily code news, weekly digest, and monthly events.

Our Mission Statement:

> We are a "made by devs for devs" community, founded with the utopian objective of making code accessible for everyone.

To elaborate further, we firmly believe in free access to coding and education at any age. We want to help all devs, from those about to start (and I add for these, good luck!) to the most experienced ones.

Our core values ​​are equality, respect, and fun! And, as I show you now, we don't just sell smoke:

## How We Will Help You

_Or: What do we do?_ Although we have already mapped the lines of our future path, they have not yet been drawn out fully.

We plan to start as a [DEV](https://dev.to/worldindev) based blogging organization, with different series running contemporaneously.

Our presence will extend to [Discord](https://discord.gg/pkqqUj44t8), allowing us to be more user-focused. We don't want to be static. The main objective of going beyond a simple blog is to empower communication between developers and pair programming.

Look at other famous websites in programming: Stack Overflow, GitHub, or even DEV. They are all based on devs helping other devs. And this is what we want to do.

To do this, we are building a cooperation program between developers. The ones more experimented will partner with a newcomer in programming. Then each binomial can participate in coding events that we will host, with special prizes for 🏆winners🏆.

## Our Publications

This leads to another of our significant objectives. We will be 𝕒𝕔𝕥𝕚𝕧𝕖, mostly with daily articles and monthly events, and trying to improve every day.

### ARTICLES

* +2 unique articles every month for our [Patreon members](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=52617503)

* Flowchart Image

### EVENTS

#### **--> Blogging Support**

This is what I am most proud of, because I would have dreamed of having it when I started. We think that knowledge should have no limits, so every dev should blog about what they know.

We provide free chat support for the entire process of creating a blog, from setup to publishing the first articles. And all the articles written with us will be featured in our daily digest! Now you understand why it's my favorite?

#### **--> Pair Programming**

Our server provides a program to stimulate creativity and teamwork, that needs to be enhanced in programming. We will create pairs with a more experienced developer and a less experienced one.

They can get to know each other, exchange questions (especially for the newcomer), and train together. But above all, they can participate at...

#### **--> Code Battles!**

We have in mind lots of weird and funny things to make devs compete. As we want to encourage our binomial program, many of our challenges will be in pairs.

For example, only the less experienced of the two can write the code, but they can stay on the call with their partner. We will also try to do more serious events like mini hackathons.

#### **--> 100 Days of Code**

We encourage the brave who want to start or are doing the #100daysofcode. So we are creating a program to help those individuals, more on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pkqqUj44t8).

#### **--> Dev Talks***

We will need 1k+ members for that, but one of our dreams is to invite successful developers to talk at live events hosted on Discord.

NOTE: Events Only Available on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pkqqUj44t8)

![line break](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ash96231zzgp1b26ijw.gif)

## 🎉Giveaways🎉

In addition to our events, we will organize giveaways every month.

We are fronting the money for the first months, but then we hope to offer more essential prizes (or more prizes every month) thanks to sponsors and the great [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=52617503) supporters. However, there will be more members afterward, therefore less chance of winning.

For this first month (April), we will gift a free Udemy course. The earlier you enter, the more chances you have to participate and win!

## Our Plans for the Future

First, we will work to build an active community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pkqqUj44t8), [DEV](https://dev.to), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WorldInDev).

Our primary goal is to be able to help as many developers as possible by cultivating a social community. Our second goal is to host how many events as possible, giveaways, hackathons, code battles...

With a solid community, we will create a website and extension to help developers in their daily life in the more distant future. A kind of dev companion with lots of features, but let's say no more for now...
